## Over the summer, I created a dragon-inspired Pomodoro study timer in Android Studio as a personal project. I applied the Java programming skills I developed during my coursework to design a simple yet engaging productivity app. To make it unique, I added a creative twist: at the end of each study session, an egg hatches to reveal a baby dragon. The app also includes sound notifications to signal the start of study and break periods, making the experience both functional and fun.
